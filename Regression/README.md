# Data Science Project
## Project Description

### Welcome to the Data Science Project repository. This project focuses on building a predictive model for a target variable based on a dataset with 53 anonymized features.

## Project Structure

### The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for model training (`train.py`) and model inference (`predict.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.


## Getting Started

#### Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd data-science-project

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate


pip install -r requirements.txt


## Project Summary

This project aims to build a predictive model for the target variable using machine learning techniques. The project structure is designed to help you explore the data, train a model, and make predictions on new data.

Feel free to customize the model, explore different algorithms, and improve performance metrics. Don't forget to commit your changes and push to your own GitHub repository.
