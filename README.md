# Quantum Data Science Project

## Project Description

### Welcome to the Quantum Data Science Project repository. This project focuses on building a predictive model for a target variable based on a dataset with 53 anonymized features.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for model training (`train.py`) and model inference (`predict.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. ### Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-data-science-project.git```

2. ### Navigate to the project directory:
cd quantum-data-science-project

3. ### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv

4. ### Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate 

5. ### Install project dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Open the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`:
   jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb

## Run the training script to train the model:

python src/train.py

## to make predictions on the hidden test data, run the inference script:
python src/predict.py

## Project Summary

This project aims to build a predictive model for the target variable using machine learning techniques. The project structure is designed to help you explore the data, train a model, and make predictions on new data.

Feel free to customize the model, explore different algorithms, and improve performance metrics. Don't forget to commit your changes and push to your own GitHub repository.
